    	People say that cartoon is for children. While that is mostly true, it would be unfair to state that everything the world of animation has to offer is aimed at kids. Japanese animation, popularly known as anime, is a prime example. Certain anime have their target audience outside the set of innocent infants and AoT belongs to that group.

    	<h6>The animation in this show, especially in the action sequences, is top-notch.</h6></figure>

    	Attack on Titan (AoT) is an action-fantasy anime that first aired in 2013. Since its inception, the series has garnered a massive fan following in Japan and abroad as well. A total of three seasons have been released so far, with the fourth and final season reportedly set to release later this year. AoT is set in a world where humans are forced to retreat behind humongous walls
        to save themselves from getting eaten by giant humanoids called 'titans'. At first glance, the premise might seem a standard trope of the dark fantasy genre but there is *much* more to it than meets the eye.<br><br><br>
        The first season is more of an action spectacle, complete with breathtaking visuals and complementary music. The anime establishes its high stakes as early as the first episode and then keeps on ramping them up throughout its course.
        The plot moves at a more than decent pace and keeps you interested. At the same time it should be noted that the opening season doesn't quite justify the enormous hype surrounding it. In short, it feels quite good but not great. 
        But you don't need to worry since Attack On Titan is a series that keeps getting better with each season.<br><br>
        It is from Season 2 when AoT brings more substance to the fore without sacrificing its style. The anime is renowned for its 'what just happened' moments and one is sure to feel it in this short 12-episode season. <br><br>Then the show takes a detour from all the violence and mayhem in the first part of season 3 to venture into political domain.  It introduces a few characters and they do fit well in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>
        Season 3 Part 2 is arguably AoT's high point with its iconic moments and startling revelations. No wonder then that two of its episodes star in the top 3 <a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_episode&num_votes=1000,&sort=user_rating,desc">highest rated episodes</a> of all time on IMDb.  The ending sets up for a cracking finale
        which hopefully we'll get to witness soon. <br><br>
  		A discussion surrounding Attack on Titan is surely incomplete without the mention of its opening themes. They succeed in giving goosebumps and pique the interest in the series. Special mention to the haunting BGM which elevates the action onscreen.<br><br>
        It is not all blood and g(l)ory here though - AoT has got some heart-wrenching scenes brimming with emotion. The best part of AoT is that the storyline stuns you with its constant but unpredictable barrage of plot twists and shocking moments. A lot of supporting characters are present and most of them get a time to shine. Some of their decisions make you question what morality really is. <br><br><br>
        All in all, this is a very well-crafted series which deserves to be viewed once.
